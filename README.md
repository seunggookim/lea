This MATLAB package is to perform linearized encodign analysis on time series data (see [Kim, 2022, Frontiers in Neuroscience](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.928841)).

This version (v20240902) is for a tutorial at KSMPC (Korean Society for Music Perception and Cognition) Summer School 2024 [[only Korean]](https://www.ksmpc.kr/single-post/2024-%EC%A0%9C-3-%ED%9A%8C-%ED%95%9C%EA%B5%AD%EC%9D%8C%EC%95%85%EC%A7%80%EA%B0%81%EC%9D%B8%EC%A7%80%ED%95%99%ED%9A%8C-%EC%97%AC%EB%A6%84%ED%95%99%EA%B5%90). Currently, only nested leave-one-stimulus-out cross-validation is implemented. Each response unit is optimized seperately via grid search, but all stimulus features are regularized by a single lambda.

See README.mlx on MATLAB to learn more about it.
